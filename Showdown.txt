<b><u>[SHIDO's Guide]</u></b> <br/><br/>

Team vs. Team.  (We will probably be matched against ANG)<br/>
* No permanent loss of troops!<br/>
* Win Diamonds,  Advanced Teleporter, Gold pieces.<br/><br/>
There are two leagues: L1 19:00 and L2 02:00 UTC.<br/><br/>
❗YOU NEED TO REQUEST in which league you want to play❗<br/><br/>
* Go to the Showdown Event tab, select your League, and make your request.<br/>
* Leadership has the final say of league teams.

Showdown Event:<br/><br/>

Important to be there at start.<br/>
Goal to grab buildings as they become available,  port next to them and control them.  Have reinforcements help hold them.  Center building most important. <br/>
Rally to help conquer tough targets.<br/><br/>

If low TC or very outnumbered, stay in protected red zone and send squads out.<br/>
If enemy has many low TC, burn their TCs. (prevent their resource collection.)<br/>
If a whale. Keep taking builds and move on; have teammates reinforce.<br/>
If a whale kill off enemy high TCs.<br/><br/>

Showdown is the most dynamic game, shift strategies depending on your and enemy #s & TC levels, and changing building goals.  It is good to coordinate in chat.<br/><br/>

Read the event explanation before playing.  There are many goals, and the board changes. <br/><br/>

If you are weak, focus on collecting resources as available.<br/>
'mines" come later in the game. <br/>
When a team loses control of a building their points scatter around the building.  grab them quickly,  porting if necessary. <br/><br/>

Winning is based on points, but there are many strategies you can combine to get there.<br/>
* Building control.<br/>
* Enemy force elimination.<br/>
* Resource collection. <br/><br/>

You teleport next to a building to more rapidly control,  rally, and reinforce. <br/><br/>

But the enemy might teleport and attack your TC while you take the building.  A good technique for driving off assistance.<br/><br/>

For Showdown, recall gatherers and heals troops before starting.<br/><br/>

It's a numbers game.  Please show up.
