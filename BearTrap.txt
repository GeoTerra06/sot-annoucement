🐾 Rows 1-3 can and should start rallies!<br/>
🐾 Rally Leaders must have a Town Centre level 26 or higher — and should use any of their 3 strongest heroes.<br/>
🐾 Rally Joiners: Prioritize sending Amadeus, Chenko, or Yeonwoo as your lead hero.<br/>
•     If none of the above is available, send troops without heroes.<br/><br/>
🚫 Important Reminders:<br/><br/>
❌ Squads not following these rules will be removed from the rally<br/><br/>
🐾 Only archers and heroes contribute to the score — make sure to pre-save squads with the appropriate heroes and aim for a 10/10/80 ratio (Infantry/Cavalry/Archers), based on your archer availability.<br/><br/>
Let’s coordinate well and crush this event — see you at the trap! 💥🎯
